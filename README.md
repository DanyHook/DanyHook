## 👨‍💻 About Me

🎨 The Creative Strategist in the Data Lab
Daniel López is a rare hybrid: part data detective, part digital alchemist. By day, he wrangles Python scripts and DEI campaigns with precision and purpose. By night, he conjures AI art, layers shaders in p5.js, and turns emotional storms into creative fuel.

He’s a quiet force — introspective but unyielding, someone who’s weathered emotional avalanches yet still crafts stories, visuals, and experiences that speak louder than words. Whether it’s decoding user behavior or sketching cosmic typographic boards, Daniel’s quest is always the same: to find truth, beauty, and maybe a bit of poetic justice.

🔥 Passionate. 💡 Resourceful. 🧠 Analytical.
🖤 Healing. ✨ Evolving. 🎯 Still aiming for that personal masterpiece.
